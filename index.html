                <p>My gosh..potholes EVERYWHERE! So much so we had to watch the barracades more then the scenery. The
                    one
                    most alluring exit..hanging lake was too full to park. Plus because of the road work...once you exit
                    some of these places, you can't get back on east bound to continue your journey. But it’s happening
                    y’all, say goodbye to expensive car repairs.</p>

                <p>These overgrown trees and laurel bushes are approx. 20 feet high and should be no more than 5 feet.
                    The
                    whole street is covered in leaves constantly and the overhang is completely covering the kerbs,
                    hindering visibility and making it dangerous to drive down the street. Thankfully after seeing my
                    issue,
                    the city is sending people to help!</p>

                <p>There is some ongoing road work right in front of the hotel. Work seems to go on All day/ night
                    (except
                    Sunday). So the noise was pretty bad at some point. They’re finally working on that patch of road
                    where
                    a couple people blew their tires.</p>
